This was a research project that presents an application for editing, traversing, and exporting graph structures using a graphical user interface. The features the application offers include:
 - Inserting and deleting vertices and edges
 - Updating properties of vertices and edges, such as their position, colour, weight, or label
 - Viewing the adjacency matrix of a completed graph
 - Performing graph traversals, such as depth-first and breadth-first traversals
 - Performing shortest path algorithms between two nodes on a weighted, directed graph
 - Saving and loading graphs as a special data format
 - Exporting graphs as `.PNG` images
